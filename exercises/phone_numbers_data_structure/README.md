# Phone Numbers Data Structure

## Description

In an earlier class, we put student contact information in a complex data structure (hash of hashes of arrays).  Put this information in a Google Spreadsheet instead.

## Instructions

When tracking contact information, hashes of hashes of arrays (or some structure like that) can serve you well.  However, we can do better.

Open up Google Spreadsheets and create a new spreadsheet.  Use this spreadsheet to store the following information:

* All student first names and last names
* Student addresses (home and work)
* Student phone numbers (mobile, home (hahaha), and work)
* Student e-mail addresses (as many as they want)
* Student final project groups
