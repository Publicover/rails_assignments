# Phone Numbers

## Description

Create a program to store names with corresponding phone numbers, then give back the correct phone number when the user enters a name.

## Instructions

Your teacher can't remember your phone number.  (Honestly, though, does anyone remember phone numbers anymore?)  In order to help him/her, you need to write a program.  This program will have two stages of execution.

In the first stage, the program will ask for a student name, then ask for that student's phone number.  Then it will ask for a name again, then ask for that second student's phone number.  This will continue until the user enters a blank name.

Once a blank name has been entered, the program will move into the second stage.  In this stage, the program will ask who the user wants to look up.  The user will enter a student's name, and the program will give back that student's phone number.  This request/response cycle will continue until the user enters a blank name, and then the program will end.
