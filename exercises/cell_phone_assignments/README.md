# Cell Phone Assignments

## Description

Create a program to store information about people and their cell phones.

## Instructions

Build a structure to keep track of phones (with their model names and selected ringtones), people (with their names), and information about which person owns which phone.  You should be able to:

* Create a new phone (once you know its model and ringtone).
* Make the phone ring (which will `puts` out the phone's ringtone).
* Create a new person (once you know his/her name and which phone he/she owns).
* Make the person say his/her name (which will `puts` "My name is ...").
* Let the person receive a call (which will cause the person's phone to ring).
