## RAILS: `form_for` Challenge

* Modify the `form_tag` in your form view to be a `form_for` instead. (Note: this will also require setting up a blank instance variable with `.new` in the controller when the form loads in the first place)

* Add a `private` strong params method in your controller to prevent mass assignment and call this method when creating your new database record when the form is submitted.

* Reflect (in your README): Do you think that strong params is a good approach to prevent mass assignment?
