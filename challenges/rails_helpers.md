## RAILS: Helpers

* Your thank-you page has four ternary operators in it.  They each take a boolean and display a "Yes" if it's true and a "No" if it's false.  Make a helper which does this for you, then call this helper four times.

* Reflect (in your README): When are partials better to use than helpers?  When is the opposite true?
