## RAILS: Partials

* Your form currently has four mostly-repeated sections, once for each question you can answer with a checkbox.  Extract this duplicated code into a partial and call the partial four times.

* Reflect (in your README): Have you used any partials in your code yet?  Would you have wanted to do it here if I hadn't explicitly asked you to?  What is/will be your threshold for deciding when to break view code out into partials?
