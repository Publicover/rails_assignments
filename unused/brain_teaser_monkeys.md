## Brain Teaser: Monkeys

A monkey and his uncle are suspended at equal distances from the floor at opposite ends of a rope which passes through a pulley. The rope weighs four ounces per foot. The weight of the monkey in pounds equals the age of the monkey's uncle in years. The age of the uncle plus that of the monkey equals four years. The uncle is twice as old as the monkey was when the uncle was half as old as the monkey will be when the monkey is three times as old as the uncle was when the uncle was three times as old as the monkey. The weight of the rope plus the weight of the monkey's uncle is one-half again as much as the difference between the weight of the monkey and that of the uncle plus the weight of the monkey.

How long is the rope?

How old is the monkey?
