# Survey Opossum Rails Prep

## Description

SurveyMonkey has started charging $4 billion per survey (not really, but go with us here). Their customers are (understandably) outraged. Being the savvy entrepreneurs that you are, you spot an opportunity and jump on it. Time to build the SurveyMonkey killer!

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Have a data structure and a skeleton Rails app ready to go for the weekend assignment.

## Deliverables

* **A Data Structure Diagram.** Before writing any code, review the requirements in the SurveyOpossum project and draw a data structure diagram for it.  It should include:
  * A box for each table
  * Each field you'll need for each table inside its box
  * A data type for each field
  * A mark to indicate that it's a required field
  * Relationships between each pair of tables with a primary/foreign key pair
* **A github organization.** Create an organization in github to represent your team for this project.  Give all team members full rights.
* **A Repository.** Create a new repository under your github organization's account.
* **A Working Heroku Link.**

## Prep Requirements

In anticipation of the upcoming project, perform the following steps tonight:

1. Create an ERD for the data structure needed to accomplish this project.
2. Create a new Rails app with all models and migrations needed for this project.
3. Scaffolding the Survey class.  That's where most of your work will be done.
4. Build login and logout functionality for authors.
5. Add the `rails-footnotes` gem to your development group.
5. Deploy to Heroku.  Make sure that you can migrate and load a page (any page) in your browser without errors.
