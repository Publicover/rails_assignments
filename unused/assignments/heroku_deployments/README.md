# My First Heroku Deployment

## Description

As pairs, merge two of your prior Rails applications together, deploy the new application to Heroku, then modify it to add Bourbon and Neat and redeploy.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand the basics of deploying Rails apps to Heroku
* Understand how to integrate tools like Bourbon and Neat into a Rails app
* Have experience bringing two disparate applications together into one

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively...

* Deploy to Heroku
* Reason about two codebases at the same time
* Use gems with Rails

## Details

### Deliverables

* A link to your final repository on GitHub.  You decide whether to use an existing repository or create a new one.  Don't forget to commit along the way.
* A link to your final deployed (and running) application on Heroku

## Normal Mode

For this assignment, you are working in pairs.  In two prior evenings, you individually worked on these projects:

* [Motivational Quotation Generator](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/assignments/motivational_quotations)
* [Wallet](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/assignments/wallet)

Your task now is to integrate a Motivational Quotation Generator into a Wallet application.  Instead of the user entering his/her mood, the set of quotations to be used should be determined by your current financial state (e.g. almost out of money, spending a lot this month, etc).  There should be at least four different financial states that pull from four different sets of quotations.

The trick: each of the partners has to contribute one of the two source applications.  Both of the source applications can't have been written by the same person.

After you merge the applications, you should deploy to Heroku.  Then add Bourbon and Neat to your application, clean up the styling, and redeploy.
