## RAILS: HTML Forms Challenge

* Now that you've implemented REST, write an `edit` page which allows you to modify an existing survey response.  You can copy and paste the form tags from ye olde `home/form` if thou wouldst like.

* Edit an existing response.  Uncheck a box which you had previously checked.  When you go back to edit that response again, the box will still be checked.  RAGE!  Fix this bug.

* Reflect (in your README): Can you think of a better user interface for this information rather than showing a series of checkboxes?
