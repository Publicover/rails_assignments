# Teacherbook Authorization

## Description

Add a new public controller to Teacherbook which will be accessible to anyone, even without logging in.

## Instructions

You have built an app that only teachers can access, but now everyone else at the school would like to be able to access a different section of the app.  Let's say that it's a calendar of upcoming school events, and login isn't necessary to see it.

Add a new controller called "events" to Teacherbook.  This controller can say whatever you want, but it must be accessible to anyone, even if they haven't logged in.  The rest of the app should still require teacher login.
