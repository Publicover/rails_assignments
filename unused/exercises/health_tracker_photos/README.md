# Health Tracker Photos

## Description

Modify your Health Tracker app to display a different header photo on each of the four index pages.  Don't link out to the photos, but have the photos stored in your app.

## Instructions

Your health tracker app has become all the rage for the fitness geeks in the development community.  However, you want to expand your market beyond developers.  While we only care about functionality, the general public needs to have obnoxious things like "color" and "images."

Place an image related to each specific database table on each corresponding index page.  For instance, the "calories consumed" page could have an image of a cupcake, while the "exercise" page could have an image of running shoes.

Do NOT link out to the Internet in `src` attributes.  Instead, save the images in your app and display them from there.
