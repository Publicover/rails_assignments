# Super Simple Search

## Description

Given code that fills an array with names and then allows the user to search on it, modify the code to use a hash instead of an array.

## Instructions

You are a very forgetful teacher.  You have stored all of your students' names in an array, and you've written a program which asks you for a name and then tells you whether or not the person with that name is in your class.  However, since you are a programming instructor, you feel like you could write the same thing in a much simpler way using a Hash.  You're not quite sure, but you have a feeling.

Open the `super_simple_search.rb` file and review its contents.  Modify the code to do the same thing, but using a Hash.
