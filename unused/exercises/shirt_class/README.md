# Shirt Class

## Description

Given an existing class, identify its components, describe how you would use it, find a bug, and improve its default behavior.

## Instructions

You are the manager of an ecommerce site that sells shirts.  You have an application developed by an outside company, and they have fallen off the face of the earth.  You have the code they wrote for you, however, and you need to make some modifications.

Open the `shirt.rb` file and review its contents.  Determine on the following:

* Which method is a class method?
* Outside of this class, what two lines of code could you write to create a shirt object that is Blue, then change its color to Green?
* One of the instance methods has a bug in it.  Where is it?
* Which method is considered a "getter?"
* Which method is considered a "setter?"
* What single line of code could you write to replace both the getter and setter at once?
* What could you change about line 2 (and only line 2) to allow you to call Shirt.new without any parameters?
