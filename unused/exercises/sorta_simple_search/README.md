# Sorta Simple Search

## Description

Create code to find all the people who love a particular food.  Their names are stored as keys in a hash, and their favorite foods are stored as values in the hash.

## Instructions

You love to bake.  You also know the favorite foods of all your friends, and you've stored that information in a hash (because, really, who wouldn't?).  Given this hash (in `sorta_simple_search.rb`), write a program which asks you for the food that you're baking today and gives you back a list of names of your friends who love it.
