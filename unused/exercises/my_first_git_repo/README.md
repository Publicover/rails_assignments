# My First Git Repo

## Description

Create a few files and go through the basic git workflow.

## Instructions

You are (somewhat obviously) a programmer.  In this example, you are also an indecisive programmer.  You happen to follow the steps below, and because of your indecisiveness, you realize that git is your friend.

* Create github repository.  Create a file.  git add.  git commit.  git push.
* Edit file once.  git add.  git commit.
* Edit file again.  git add.
* Look at all three files.
