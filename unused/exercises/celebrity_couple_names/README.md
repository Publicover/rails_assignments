# Celebrity Couple Names

## Description

Create a method which takes two names (for people) and returns an array of possible celebrity couple names for the pair.

## Instructions

You are a publicist, and your clients are celebrities.  Rather than letting the press (and the somewhat-frightening Internet at large) decide how to talk about your clients, you like to be proactive and get catchy news started about them yourself.

Celebrity couples often go by names like "Brangelina", where the couple name starts with one person's name and ends with the other's.  This strategy isn't guaranteed to return a good name, however.  "Brna" does start with Brad and end with Angelina, but that name is... sort of dumb.  Because of this, you need a method which will take two names and find ALL possible celebrity names so that the you can look at all the options and decide for yourself which name is best.

Your programming task is to create a method that takes two strings as parameters and returns an array of strings.
